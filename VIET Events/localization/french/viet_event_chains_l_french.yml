 VIETmisc.1000.t:0 "xxxxx"
 VIETmisc.1000.desc:0 "xxxxx"
 VIETmisc.1000.a:0 "xxxxx"
 VIETmisc.1001.t:0 "Sentiment de vent d'hiver"
 VIETmisc.1001.desc:0 "As the winter wind begins to come down this year, the chill in the air reminds me of someone dear to my heart, someone I had not thought about for years."
 VIETmisc.1001.a:0 "Elle."
 VIETmisc.1002.t:0 "Mes souvenirs sont toujours magnifiques"
 VIETmisc.1002.desc:0 "Do I want to remember?\n\nAs much as it pains me, thinking about her still makes me so happy all the while."
 VIETmisc.1002.a:0 "Back then...."
 VIETmisc.1003.t:0 "Malgré une feuille de larmes gelées"
 VIETmisc.1003.desc:0 "She was a girl who lived nearby. I think she was of high birth - otherwise how would I have been able to play with her in the first place? - but her family was impoverished and had little influence on local affairs.\n\nWe played a lot as children, her and me, the both of us. A happy little boy and girl, two innocents without a care in the world.\n\nNow, I’m starting to really miss those times."
 VIETmisc.1003.a:0 "Je me sens mélancolique."
 VIETmisc.1004.t:0 "And I Don’t Remember"
 VIETmisc.1004.desc:0 "Unfortunately a lot of my memories of that girl are hazy.\n\nIt's been many years, after all.\n\nVague visions briefly flash through my mind, as I struggle to remember what happened all those years ago."
 VIETmisc.1004.a:0 "It’s been a while, after all."
 VIETmisc.1005.t:0 "Pourquoi j'ai renversé ces larmes ?"
 VIETmisc.1005.desc:0 "For instance, I vaguely recall some argument we had. It was years later when we were a little older - not quite adults, but not little children either, though we were still young, and like all young people we did stupid things after all.\n\nI think I said some really nasty things to her.\n\nWait, that’s what happened, right? I don’t exactly recall.\n\nMaybe it was something else? Perhaps I offended her somehow and didn’t properly apologize?"
 VIETmisc.1005.a:0 "Whatever it was, I regretted doing it."
 VIETmisc.1006.t:0 "Maintenant, les vents hivernaux d'antan"
 VIETmisc.1006.desc:0 "C'était quoi cette discussion déjà ? Oh, ça devait être en hiver, je pense. Argh ! Ça me met trop de mauvais humeur. Bon, bon, j'étais jeune, j'étais jeune, mais bon, personne ne devrait dire ce genre de choses."
 VIETmisc.1006.a:0 "Je m'excuserai si je le pouvais."
 VIETmisc.1007.t:0 "Remontons dans le temps"
 VIETmisc.1007.desc:0 "Why did we even fight that time? We made up so quickly, as young people are wont to do, but I am rather curious now. What was it that got us into that argument in the first place?\n\nSuch a bothersome thing to remember.\n\nRegardless, how I wish I could go back, make sure it never happened! Admittedly, I’m probably thinking about this too much, anyways."
 VIETmisc.1007.a:0 "Nous nous sommes réconcilié, après tout."
 VIETmisc.1008.t:0 "Une incompréhension"
 VIETmisc.1008.desc:0 "Hmm. Now that I think it over, our conflict must have started with some sort of misunderstanding. It had to be.\n\nWe usually got along, that girl and I, and we shared things and agreed with each other many times. Surely there was some sort of misunderstanding - yes, that had to be it."
 VIETmisc.1008.a:0 "Et à partir de ceci, nous avons eu notre dispute ...?"
 VIETmisc.1009.t:0 "A Moment’s Hesitation"
 VIETmisc.1009.desc:0 "Peut-être qu'elle m'a posé une question très délicate, et je n'ai pas répondu immédiatement, lui faisant penser avoir eu une réponse négative ?"
 VIETmisc.1009.a:0 "Peut-être."
 VIETmisc.1010.t:0 "Sentimentalisme cliché"
 VIETmisc.1010.desc:0 "Or perhaps she wanted some romance - we were just starting to come to that age after all - but I misinterpreted her advances. It would be a bit of a cliche if that were the case, though."
 VIETmisc.1010.a:0 "Peut-être."
 VIETmisc.1011.t:0 "Le moment parfait"
 VIETmisc.1011.desc:0 "What was it? I at least recall that she asked me something, yes, that was it, that’s what started this all. But I don’t quite remember what. Not yet, at least.\n\nShe did seem nervous, didn’t she? I now recall that.\n\nMaybe she had waited a long time to hear my answer to whatever she asked - to clear up some sort of misunderstanding, or to confirm something."
 VIETmisc.1011.a:0 "Hmm...."
 VIETmisc.1012.t:0 "Perdu à jamais"
 VIETmisc.1012.desc:0 "But anyways, I still miss that girl. We were such good friends.... And one has to wonder, could our relationship have deepened into something more beautiful?"
 VIETmisc.1012.a:0 "I'll never know."
 VIETmisc.1013.t:0 "Encore une fois, jamais plus"
 VIETmisc.1013.desc:0 "If we met again, I’d make sure we wouldn’t get into those sort of arguments, ever again. It’d just be like the good days, when we’d mess around and enjoy ourselves, when we did not have to worry about adult responsibilities. No more stupid arguments. No more."
 VIETmisc.1013.a:0 "I do miss her, don’t I?"
 VIETmisc.1014.t:0 "Je reste jeune et confiant"
 VIETmisc.1014.desc:0 "Though, now that I think about it, thinking that you will never get into stupid arguments is kind of naive. Only children think that everybody can simply get along with each other. The world just doesn’t work like that.\n\nYet, to be honest, I wanted - and want - that sort of relationship with that girl.\n\nA pure companionship.\n\nA pure love."
 VIETmisc.1014.a:0 "I suppose I’m still childish in a way, then."
 VIETmisc.1015.t:0 "Avec mon amour non-dit"
 VIETmisc.1015.desc:0 "Now I realize.\n\nI did love her after all.\n\nI wanted to be with her forever - silly, isn’t it? I thought she was the most wonderful person, the most perfect woman."
 VIETmisc.1015.a:0 "Pourtant, je ne lui ai jamais dit."
 VIETmisc.1016.t:0 "Et les souvenirs paralysent"
 VIETmisc.1016.desc:0 "Oh, wait now....\n\nNow I remember what she asked me.\n\nI can’t believe it. It’s so cliched. I should have remembered after all these years. She said it so randomly, so suddenly that day:"
 VIETmisc.1016.a:0 ""Hey, [ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] do you love me?""
 VIETmisc.1017.t:0 "Encore une fois, jamais plus"
 VIETmisc.1017.desc:0 "I didn’t answer her at the time. But if she were here now, and asked me that question again, what would I tell her? Would I answer "yes"?"
 VIETmisc.1017.a:0 "Yes. Yes, a million times over, yes."
 VIETmisc.1018.t:0 "Je n'ai jamais répondu"
 VIETmisc.1018.desc:0 "And so I finally recall now why she was so angry.\n\nI didn’t give her any sort of proper response that day."
 VIETmisc.1018.a:0 "Cela a dû l'avoir blessé profondément."
 VIETmisc.1019.t:0 "Ce qui me fait mal"
 VIETmisc.1019.desc:0 "Maybe all these years, she wondered whether that boy ever truly loved her. Maybe all these years.\n\nFrankly, it hurts me too, that I never gave her a proper answer."
 VIETmisc.1019.a:0 "Et je ne le pourrai jamais."
 VIETmisc.1020.t:0 "Mais je suis toujours de toute beauté"
 VIETmisc.1020.desc:0 "I wonder if she were here, now, what she would think. Would she even accept my resounding answer of "Yes!" to her question?\n\nI hope - and I only hope - that she would still think of me highly. I haven’t done many great things in life, but, then, nobody’s perfect. Back then, she always encouraged me to do my best."
 VIETmisc.1020.a:0 "I hope she is proud of me...."
 VIETmisc.1021.t:0 "Et laisser tout derrière"
 VIETmisc.1021.desc:0 "But she is no longer here. Even though we made up after the incident, we soon became adults and, of course, we soon parted afterwards - parted forever.\n\nIt was inevitable, I suppose. We were young. We didn't realize that our childhood wouldn't last forever.\n\nNothing lasts forever. Nothing bad, nothing good."
 VIETmisc.1021.a:0 "Nothing."
 VIETmisc.1022.t:0 "La chaleur de votre peau"
 VIETmisc.1022.desc:0 "But to this day, I still think of that silly girl. I still think of that stupid, silly way she smiled. I still think of those times we sat under that tree, side by side, our shoulders touching as we smiled and laughed and talked about nothing.\n\nMy friend.\n\nMy companion.\n\nMy inspiration.\n\nMy angel."
 VIETmisc.1022.a:0 "Mon premier amour."
 # Cinnamon Toast Crunch (the first VIET event chain ever)
 VIETmisc.1023.t:0 "Cinnamon!"
 VIETmisc.1023.desc:0 "It's no secret. I'm in love with cinnamon. When I was younger I didn't eat too much of it, but when I did, I enjoyed it greatly. Now that I am older, I can procure as much cinnamon as my treasury can handle. I like the swirls of spicy and sweet in every bite! There's nothing like cinnamon!"
 VIETmisc.1023.a:0 "Who can't see why I love the taste of cinnamon?"
 VIETmisc.1024.t:0 "A Taste of Cinnamon"
 VIETmisc.1024.desc:0 "I have a feast coming up. Many important people in my realm will be there. We will celebrate life and have a good time, and I intend to do that by serving everybody as many savory and sweet cinnamon dishes as possible, including my favorite - cinnamon toasted sticky buns. Everyone will see why I love the taste of cinnamon.\n\nUnfortunately cinnamon is an expensive delicacy. The cost for this otherwise mundane feast will be a bit high. But I crave those crazy spices! I just crave them!"
 VIETmisc.1024.a:0 "The feast will be cinnamon themed, no matter the cost."
 VIETmisc.1025.t:0 "Cinnamon, Cinnamon Everywhere"
 VIETmisc.1025.desc:0 "The food at the feast was delicious! Cinnamon oil to cook everything in. Cinnamon and garlic flavored fish. Cinnamon sprinkled in soups. Cinnamon in meat pies and sweet pies. Cinnamon spread on bread and fruit. And my favorite, cinnamon and honey-syrup slathered sticky buns! In fact I can't even remember what didn't have cinnamon at the feast.\n\nApparently some of my guests appreciated my tastes. Others didn't, however. I could see it in their eyes. The way their eyes shifted around when they looked at their food. The way they slowly ate it.\n\nHow sad, that there are people who cannot appreciate cinnamon!"
 VIETmisc.1025.a:0 "Some of my courtiers seemed concerned - they think I'm overdoing things! Ha!"
 VIETmisc.1026.t:0 "Crazy for Cinnamon"
 VIETmisc.1026.desc:0 "A few of my courtiers told me they were concerned about my eating habits. I eat cinnamon with everything, they claimed! But that of course is not true. I definitely eat other things.\n\nThey stubbornly insisted, however, that eating too much cinnamon wasn't good, despite whatever healing benefits it may have, and that I'd regret my irrational addiction.\n\nBut the thing is, I really do eat other things. Do people think I'm insane just because I had a cinnamon-themed feast? Can't they see why I love the taste of cinnamon?\n\nI'm feeling like some cinnamon toasted sticky buns for breakfast for tomorrow, anyhow. Or the next few days. Or weeks."
 VIETmisc.1026.a:0 "Who cares what they say? I'll have breakfast on a whole other level!"
 VIETmisc.1027.t:0 "Midas Fingers of Cinnamon"
 VIETmisc.1027.desc:0 "Maybe wanting the taste of cinnamon in the morning wasn't a good idea. After eating some cinnamon toasted sticky buns (my favorite cinnamon food!), my hands were so sticky, I got cinnamon and honey-syrup all over my fine robes, my face, my chair... everything I touch becomes a mess! However, I have an important meeting with my councillors right now, and I don't want to be late - what can I do? But I have no choice, as this is an important meeting."
 VIETmisc.1027.a:0 "Hopefully my councillors won't be too irritated with me."
 VIETmisc.1028.t:0 "They're Great! (Really!)"
 VIETmisc.1028.desc:0 "The meeting went alright, though my sticky cinnamon-covered fingers were a distraction. Thankfully I managed to prevent the stickiness from spreading everywhere. My councillors, instead of being irritated, found my situation hilarious. They made fun of not only me, but worse, of cinnamon itself! It appears now that everyone in my court is making fun of me.\n\nHow can someone as high as myself be the laughstock of the entire realm, simply because I love the taste of cinnamon? My courtiers and vassals always plot and see everything I do. But can they see why I love the taste of cinnamon toast sticky buns?"
 VIETmisc.1028.a:0 "They have to understand. The swirls of spicy and sweet cinnamon in every bite!"
 VIETmisc.1029.t:0 "The Taste I Can See"
 VIETmisc.1029.desc:0 "I tried to explain to my courtiers. I really did! Cinnamon is so wonderful. Why would anyone not love it? Everything simply tastes better with it, whether it's eggs, waffles, sausages, beans, sweet buns, milk, or water... anything really. Even peasant gruel tastes like heavenly nectar if I add some cinnamon too it.\n\nBut no. No one understood. I asked them why cinnamon was so great. Why I had to like it. But no one came up with the right answers, and I must resign myself to the fact that no one will know why I love the taste of cinnamon. Why I love the taste of cinnamon toasted sticky buns, especially."
 VIETmisc.1029.a:0 "It's because there's a swirl of delicious cinnamon flavor in every bite."

 VIETmisc.1030.t:0 "Final Days"
 VIETmisc.1030.desc.male:0 "I have an elderly servant I am deeply attached to. For many years, she has served me loyally without complaint, and put up with all me - if there is anyone I cannot bear to be cruel to, it is this woman who has become like a beloved aunt or grandmother to me. But for the past few weeks, she has been on her deathbed, barely conscious, muttering strange things, and refusing food and drink."
 VIETmisc.1030.desc.female:0 "I have an elderly servant I am deeply attached to.

 VIETmisc.1030.a:0 "We keep a vigil day and night, but we know it's only a matter of time."
 VIETmisc.1031.t:0 "Awake"
 VIETmisc.1031.desc.male:0 "One morning, I am chanting a few prayers quietly to myself for my servant's soul along with a few others in our household, when I get a little tired and decide to sit down next to her. I reach out and hold her hand - yet, as I do so, a miracle happens! She opens her eyes and looks around, as if trying to make sense of her surroundings. The moment she gazes at me, however, a look of utter happiness and deep love spreads across her face.\n\n"How are you feeling?" I say. "It's fine, don't worry. I'm here.""

 VIETmisc.1033.desc.male:0 "After the funeral of my beloved servant, I ask several of her relatives about what she told me before passing. It is clearly evident that she mistook me for someone else. At first, no one had any answers, until we managed to get hold of her younger sister, one of my other servants, who is very elderly herself.\n\nThis old lady, despite her age, has a look of strength and confidence about her as she calmly chuckles, "Ah, it's a funny coincidence, [ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip].""

 VIETmisc.1034.t:0 "Coincidence"
 VIETmisc.1034.desc.male:0 "[ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] was also the name of her first love," her sister explains. "They truly loved each other. But her beloved was in an accident the day before their wedding and he died in her arms, something she always felt guilt over it. I don't remember if you look like her beloved, as I was a little girl then, and am quite old now, so my memory may be failing me. It doesn't matter, though."\n\nI nod slowly. "That is a strange coincidence.""

 VIETmisc.1035.desc.male:0 ""Perhaps it is mere chance, perhaps it is fate. Whatever it is, I am glad that in her final moments, she could gaze upon her beloved," the old lady says. She pauses for a few moments, trying to compose herself as she is clearly deeply moved by this all. "I have not always been the best sister and have caused my older sister a lot of stress - it's something younger siblings are often guilty of - so for giving her that gift of joy and love in her final moments of life, I thank you sincerely from the bottom of my heart."\n\n"Perhaps they are together now at last, in the afterlife," I suggest.\n\nThe old lady pauses again, before she smiles gently."

 VIETmisc.1036.desc:0 "For the last week or so, I have been feeling tired a lot. Therefore, I decided to sleep early today. Soon after, I find myself somewhere in the wilderness I do not recognize. It is a vast expanse of the greenest grass, dotted with fields of vibrant flowers of every color imaginable, flanked on both sides by breathtaking, snow-capped mountains. Above, the sun shines brightly.\n\n"Little [ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]!" a voice calls to me. "Little [ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]!""

 VIETmisc.1037.desc:0 "Before my very eyes stands my [scope_VIET_grandparent_dream.Custom('VIETGrandparent')], the late [scope_VIET_grandparent_dream.GetTitledFirstName]. I don't quite recognize [scope_VIET_grandparent_dream.GetHerHim] at first, yet something within the dream, within myself, tells me this IS my [scope_VIET_grandparent_dream.Custom('VIETGrandparent')], no matter what my rational side may think.\n\nI am a child again, small and in awe of everything, and my [scope_VIET_grandparent_dream.Custom('VIETGrandparent')] looks so tall and comforting, as [scope_VIET_grandparent_dream.GetSheHe] embraces me warmly and takes my little hand.\n\n "Little one, I'm glad I found you," [scope_VIET_grandparent_dream.GetSheHe] says.\n\n"What are you doing here?" I squeak, my voice exactly high-pitched like when I was young. "What's going on? Why are we here? Did I do something wrong?"\n\n"No, no. You've been a good [ROOT.Char.Custom('GirlBoy')]," [scope_VIET_grandparent_dream.GetSheHe] reassures me. "Ah... you know I love you, right?""

 VIETmisc.1039.t:0 "Morning"
 VIETmisc.1039.desc:0 "I slowly awake as I hear the birds chirping outside. I sit up, and recall my dream in vivid detail, almost as if it were real. Why did I dream of my [scope_VIET_grandparent_dream.Custom('VIETGrandparent')], like that? It was such a comforting dream, as if I felt a great sense of relief wash over me that was helping me prepare for something profound.

Yet this doesn't alarm me as it normally would - it is comforting, as if [scope_VIET_grandparent_dream.GetSheHe] is watching over me, preparing me for something.

There is something profound, yet mysterious about it, even though it is just a dream. Still, at the end of the day, as strange as it is, I also find these dreams comforting.

For a while I'm confused, until I recall the visions I've had - both in my dreams and what I see in real life - about my [scope_VIET_grandparent_dream.Custom('VIETGrandparent')]. Upon doing so, I feel a sense of realization and inner peace. Finally, I understand.\n\nThe people around me are confused when I explain, though. That's fine. They will understand in time, when it is their turn to prepare for the journey we all must go on.\n\nThat evening, I lie down in bed and rest; even though I refuse food or drink when offered, I feel light and refreshed.\n\nI gaze around one last time, before closing my eyes."

After what seems like an immeasurable amount of time, I see [scope_VIET_grandparent_dream.GetTitledFirstName], my [scope_VIET_grandparent_dream.Custom('VIETGrandparent')]. I am a child once more, just like in the dreams I had before, and [scope_VIET_grandparent_dream.GetSheHe] towers over me, but comfortingly so.\n\n"Are you ready to go, little "[ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]?" [scope_VIET_grandparent_dream.GetSheHe] asks. "I know it's hard to let go, but you can do it! Everyone must make this journey eventually."\n\n"I think I'm ready," I mutter. I offer my hand to [scope_VIET_grandparent_dream.GetHerHim]. "And I'm with you, so I'll be fine! I love you!"\n\nMy [scope_VIET_grandparent_dream.Custom('VIETGrandparent')] gently holds my hand and smiles."
 VIETmisc.1044.a:0 ""I love you too. Let's go then, little one.""
